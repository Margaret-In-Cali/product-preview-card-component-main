## My process

I enjoyed this project. It was a little more involved than the QR Code challenge. I made sure to add alt text to all images (a task I missed in the last challenge), and I relied more heavily on block elements instead of making everything a div, as someone in the community suggested to me last time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I wrestled a little bit with the border radius of several elements and needed to review the shorthand, so as to make the entire card appear as one component.

### Continued development

I feel pretty comfortable coding responsive layouts, but I could definitely improve. That's what I'm going to focus on in the immediate future.
